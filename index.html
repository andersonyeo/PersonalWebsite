        <h2>Hello!</h2>
        <p class="intro">
          I am a currently a student at Universiti Malaysia Sarawak studying Computational Science.
          I was born and raised in Kuching, Sarawak, where I developed a strong interest in the way
          technology affects our day-to-day life.
          <br><br>
          Working out is just like my own drug where I cannot stand for a few days without any training
          or exercising. I started working out at 15 until now and forever, mainly focused on
          building an aesthetic body.

          <h3>Design, Development & Hacking</h3>
          <p>
            I started learning to code after completing my STPM because I wanted to acquire a new skill before entering university.
            Python was my first language, followed by C, C++, HTML and CSS. Besides coding, I also like to
            explore certain hacking skills especially in network hacking. Some tools that I frequently use in Kali Linux
            are aircrack-ng, Wireshark, and Wifite. It feels powerful to be able to attack a WiFi network or kick someone out from a
            network, isn't it? However, with great power comes great responsibility. Never hack or attack other people's network without permission.

          <h3>Workout Challenge</h3>
          <p>
            But my best skill is actually doing workouts. Having no time to go to the gym? Living in tiny
            house with little space? No problem. I can workout even in extreme conditions as long as I am alive.
            I have tried diverse types of workouts including weight lifting, HIIT, tabata, yoga, aerobics and many more.
