        <h2>Hello!</h2>
        <p class="intro">
          I am a currently a student at Universiti Malaysia Sarawak studying Computational Science.
          I was born and raised in Kuching, Sarawak, where I developed a strong interest in the way
          technology affects our day-to-day life.
          <br><br>
          Working out is just like my own drug where I cannot stand for a few days without any training
          or exercising. I started working out at 15 until now and forever, mainly focused on
          building an aesthetic body.

          <h3>Design, Development & Hacking</h3>
          <p>
            After completing my STPM studies, I decided to pick up coding as a new skill before entering university. My journey began with Python, and later, 
            I dabbled with other languages such as C, C++, HTML, and CSS. But coding was not the only thing that piqued my interest. I also explored 
            various hacking skills, particularly in network hacking. Tools like aircrack-ng, Wireshark, and Wifite, which I frequently use in Kali Linux, 
            gave me a sense of empowerment to take on challenges like attacking a WiFi network or kicking someone out from a network. However, with great 
            power comes great responsibility. It is crucial to remember that these skills should only be used ethically and with proper authorization. 
            Never hack or attack someone's network without their consent.

          <h3>Workout Challenge</h3>
          <p>
            My greatest skill, without a doubt, is working out. No time to hit the gym? Living in a tiny space with limited room for exercise equipment? 
            Not a problem. I can work out even in the most extreme conditions, as long as I'm alive and kicking. Over time, I've tried and tested a wide 
            range of workout regimens, including weight lifting, HIIT, Tabata, yoga, aerobics, and more. By dedicating myself to fitness and challenging 
            myself on a regular basis, I have become a more resilient, focused, and healthy individual.
