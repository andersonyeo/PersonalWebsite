        <h2>Hello!</h2>
        <p class="intro">
          I am currently a student at Universiti Malaysia Sarawak, studying Computational Science. I was born and raised in Kuching,
          Sarawak, where I developed a strong interest in the ways technology affects our day-to-day lives.

          Working out is like my own personal drug â€“ I can't go more than a few days without training or exercising. I started working
          out at the age of 15 and have been committed to it ever since, mainly focused on building an aesthetic body.

          <h3>Design, Development & Hacking</h3>
          <p>
            After completing my STPM studies, I decided to pick up coding as a new skill before entering university. My journey began with Python, and later,
            I dabbled with other languages such as C, C++, HTML, and CSS. But coding was not the only thing that piqued my interest. I also explored
            various hacking skills, particularly in network hacking. Tools like aircrack-ng, Wireshark, and Wifite, which I frequently use in Kali Linux,
            gave me a sense of empowerment to take on challenges like attacking a WiFi network or kicking someone out from a network. However, with great
            power comes great responsibility. It is crucial to remember that these skills should only be used ethically and with proper authorization.
            Never hack or attack someone's network without their consent.

          <h3>Workout Challenge</h3>
          <p>
            My greatest skill, without a doubt, is working out. No time to hit the gym? Living in a tiny space with limited room for exercise equipment?
            Not a problem. I can work out even in the most extreme conditions, as long as I'm alive and kicking. Over time, I've tried and tested a wide
            range of workout regimens, including weight lifting, HIIT, Tabata, yoga, aerobics, and more. By dedicating myself to fitness and challenging
            myself on a regular basis, I have become a more resilient, focused, and healthy individual.
